# KarrChess

This project is developed and made primarily for the sake of learning 2 things: vim and c++
This is a personal learning project and is not ment to be used for any purpose other than my personal learning.

The goal is to make an engine which is capable of rendering a chess board and accepting inputs from players.

First goal is to make a board with moveable pieces.
